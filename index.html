		<p>Schedule at least one pleasant activity a day. When you are doing the activity, savor it. Try to fully experience it and get the maximum amount of pleasure from it. If you think about the past, the future, or anything other than the activity at hand, observe the thought and redirect your attention to the activity at hand.</p>
